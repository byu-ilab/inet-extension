/**
 * @class TCPSocketAPI_Base
 *
 * Defines a BSD-like socket API for network communications using TCP
 * sockets.
 *
 * @details
 *
 * @par Overview:
 * This base API defines functions such as socket, bind, listen, accept,
 * connect, recv, and close.  Extensions of this API are expected to define
 * a send function specific to the desired application message type (e.g.
 * TCPSocketAPI_Inet deals in cPacket objects; TCPSocketAPI_Emulation deals
 * in MetaAppMsg structs)  As in the BSD API, a socket descriptor is
 * returned from the function socket() which is thereafter used to perform
 * other operations on that socket.  Convenience functions to make active
 * or passive sockets are also defined.
 *
 * @par	TCP Socket Callback Handling:
 * The major difference from the BSD API is that this API is non-blocking
 * so as to fit into the asynchronous architecture of
 * OMNET++.  Traditionally the functions connect(), accept(), and recv() are
 * blocking system calls, meaning that they do not return until a socket is
 * connected, accepted, or data has been received over the socket respectively.
 * To make these operations work in an asynchronous environment a callback
 * must be used.
 *
 * @par
 * The callback handler specified by this base API defines a corresponding
 * callback function for the connect and accept operations.  Extensions of
 * this API should also extend the callback handler to define a callback
 * function for the recv operation specific to desired application message
 * type.  Applications that use the API should extend the callback handler
 * (or have an aggregate delegate handler) so they can appropriately process
 * the socket event.  When a socket is first created (via socket()) a pointer
 * to a callback handler must be provided, specifically a handler that extends
 * the callback handler class specific to the API extension (e.g. a
 * TCPSocketAPI_Inet::CallbackHandler is required when using the
 * TCPSocketAPI_Inet API extension).
 *
 * @par
 * After creating a socket as explained, a connect(), accept(), or recv() call
 * only informs the API that such an operation should be simulated.  After
 * calling connect(), accept(), or recv() the calling code should surrender
 * control back to the simulator (i.e. return) so that the requested operation
 * can be simulated.  When the operation finishes simulation the corresponding
 * callback will be invoked, namely: the connectCallback() is invoked when a
 * a socket is connected or fails to connect; the acceptCallback() is invoked
 * when a new connection is accepted on a listening socket; the recvCallback()
 * is invoked when data is received over a connection, the connection closes,
 * or the the connection times out.
 *
 * @par
 * The implementation of the callback should handle the event and then invoke
 * further appropriate socket operations.  The functions accept() and recv()
 * are not persistent, meaning that they may not be invoked once and thereafter
 * be expected to trigger their corresponding callback whenever an accept or
 * receive event occurs.  Generally, if repeated accept or recv operations are
 * required they should be reinvoked in the acceptCallback() or recvCallback()
 * implementation respectively; in a block socket call environment this is in essence
 * what a loop in an accepting or receiving thread does.
 *
 * @par
 * When connect(), accept(), or recv() are invoked, a pointer to any
 * element (data/struct/object) can be provided (cast it as a void pointer).
 * The API will not modify the element pointed to.  This pointer will be
 * returned in the operation's corresponding callback when the operation
 * finishes simulation.  This feature was provided with the intent that context
 * associated with a specific socket could be maintained via this API; however,
 * use of this feature is now discouraged since the API cannot deallocate the
 * element in the event that the simulation terminates abnormally, yet the using
 * application can deallocate the element if it stores the context information.
 *
 * @par	Blocking to Non-blocking Pseudocode Example:
 * In a blocking socket call environment, a client application may have the following
 * sequence of socket operations (without specific regard to the BSD API;
 * comments are between '#' symbols):
 *
 * @par
 * <pre>
 * some thread ...
 *     fd = socket ()
 *     bind(fd, local_address, local_port)
 *     connect(fd, remote_address, remote_port)
 *     send(fd, some_data)
 *     repeat until some condition
 *         data = recv(fd)
 *         # process the data #
 *         send(fd, some_more_data)
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par
 * Using this non-blocking API, the same functionality can be achieved as
 * follows:
 *
 * @par
 * <pre>
 * function: connectionInitializer
 *     fd = socket(pointer to callback interface object)
 *     bind(fd, local_address, local_port)
 *     connect(fd, remote_address, remote_port, context_data)
 *     # connectCallback will be called when the socket is connected)
 * # end of connectionInitializer #
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par
 * <pre>
 * function: connectCallback(fd, status, context_data)
 *     send(fd, some_data)

 * @par Memory Management Notes:
 * If a non-NULL element pointer is provided to a connect(), accept(), or
 * recv() invocation (this use is discouraged) the application should be
 * aware of the following memory management issues:
 *
 * @par
 * The API never assumes responsibility for deallocating from heap space any
 * non-NULL element pointer provided in a connect(), accept(), or recv()
 * invocation.  The API will, however, track the provided pointer until a
 * connect, accept, or recv operation finishes simulation and pass back the
 * pointer in the corresponding callback.  When this occurs the API stops
 * tracking the element pointer (internally it sets	its pointers to NULL).
 * The callback implementation should therefore handle the element pointer--
 * either reusing it in a subsequent connect, accept, or recv invocation, or
 * deleting	it, etc.  When a socket is closed it will return a void pointer;
 * in the event that close() is invoked after a connect, accept, or recv
 * invocation, but before the operation finishes simulation, then the pointer
 * provided in the invocation will be returned.
 *
 * @par API Extension Requirements:
 * This base API defines application data type and time type independent
 * socket operations, and is therefore functionally incomplete.  API
 * extensions should provide send and setTimeout functions specific to the
 * desired application data type and time type respectively;  API extensions
 * should also extend the CallbackHandler class to provide a recvCallback
 * function specific to the desired application data type.
 *
 * @par Possible Improvements:
 * (priority levels: low number = high priority, high number = low priority)
 *
 * @todo Level 1 Instrument with different error handling options: throw
 * exceptions (currently does); return error codes and set an error
 * description string.
 *
 * @todo Level 1 Add an emergency callback function to the callback handler
 * class that will notify the handler of abnormal socket failure, or define
 * a different exception to be thrown that will indicate that condition when
 * an operation is requested on a failed/unstable socket.
