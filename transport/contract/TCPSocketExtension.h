/**
 * This class forms a wrapper around a regular TCPSocket object.
 *
 * The TCPSocketExtension adds recv() and accept() functions to the TCPSocket.
 * Buffers received bytes and returns them as requested by the application.
 * Queues connections that have been established on a passive socket until the
 * application asks to accept them.
 *
 * The interface is based off of the BSD-like interface that TCPSocketAPI_Inet
 * defines, thus this socket extension is specific to INET time and message
 * types.
