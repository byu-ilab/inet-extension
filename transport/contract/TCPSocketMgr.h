/** \class TCPSocketMgr
 * Implements the TCPSocketAPI_Inet interface.  Uses TCPSocket objects to do so.
 * 
 * See documentation in TCPSocketAPI_Base for usage instructions.
 *
 * NOTES TO CONTRIBUTOR:
 *
 *	OVERVIEW:
 *
 *	The API was constructed taking advantage of the already existent TCPSocket
 *	and TCPSocketMap classes.  The TCPSocket's callback interface is based on
 *	events more than on socket operations, so one thing that this API does is
 *	to interpret those events back to the appropriate operations (e.g. the
 *	socketEstablished() callback could be either for a connect or accept operation).
 *	One operation that the TCPSocket doesn't have is recv, but it does define a
 *	socketDataArrived() callback.  This API interprets the socketDataArrived event
 *	as a recv() operation.
 *
 *	To support the connect(), accept(), and recv() operations, this API uses and
 *	manages callback state data to track what operation the user has most recently
 *	requested.  Not all of the enumerated callback states pertain to an operation's
 *	callback function (e.g. TCPSocketAPI::CB_S_WAIT), rather they indicate whether an operation
 *	that requires a callback can be validly invoked as well as indicating how an
 *	event signaled by the TCPSocket's callback interface should be handled.  For
 *	example recv() cannot be invoked on a socket before connect(), this is enforced
 *	by not setting the socket's associated callback data state to TCPSocketAPI::CB_S_WAIT until
 *	the socket is actually connected.  In addition, this API imposes a timed out
 *	state on sockets using the TCPSocketAPI::CB_S_TIMEOUT value while the underlying TCPSocket's
 *	actual state is still TCPSocket::CONNECTED.  This is a messy approach conceptually but
 *	required because the TCPSocket is not a cSimpleModule so it can't schedule
 *	timeout events.  This API itself could be improved by making a new TCPSocket
 *	class that would have access to scheduling events through the API and which
 *	could then be tasked with keeping track of a TIMED_OUT state, provide a recv
 *	operation, and demultiplex TCP message events directly to opertions.
 *
 *
 *	ASSUMPTIONS:
 *
 *	- Because the API forces close() to be called before a port can be reused via the
 *	bind() function, the close command will reach the TCP core before the new connect
 *	or listen command such that the port will successfully be reused.
 *
 *	- The TCP core will always (seemingly -- I haven't checked if there are options
 *	to control this) accept incoming
 *	connections to a listening socket.  However, the socket may not be accepting
 *	at the moment.  This API keeps a list of pending connections such that the
 *	next time the application invokes accept() a connection from the pending
 *	queue will be accepted.  This seems consistent with what the BSD socket API
 *	does (it specifies the queue size for pending connections and only returns
 *	a connection when accept is called once a connection is established).
 *
 *	- This API creates a receive buffer (of cPacket not bytes) in the event that
 *	packets are received when the application has not invoked recv().
 *
 *	TO IMPROVE: (priority levels: low number = high priority, high number = low priority)
 *
 *	@todo Level 1 (DONE) remove the hasCallback function from the callback interface, it isn't
 *	used and none of the callback functions will be invoked unless the user
 *	has previously invoked the corresponding operation
 *
 *	@todo Level 2 determine whether pending connections may become invalidated as they wait in
 *	the pending queue.  If they do take appropriate action to remove them from
 *	the pending connections queue.
 *
 *	@todo Level 2 assign ports when not specified in bind or connect since the underlying
 *	TCP core only assigns ports within the range 1025-5000
 *
 *	@todo Level 3 build a translator that will take in essential message parameters and return
 *	an appropriately encapsulated cMessage that can be sent, and then receive a cMessage
 *	and extract out the essential parameters
 *
 *	@todo Level 4 make a way to set error handling, different error handling options are to
 *	throw exceptions (which it does currently) or to return error codes and set an
 * error description string
 *
 *	@todo Level 4 make a way to signal to the application that the socket has been closed
 *	on a PEER_CLOSED message so that the application will not use that socket
 *	anymore?  Alternatively return an error code indicating that the socket is closed when
 *	an invalid operation is requested (i.e. recv).  In this case send will still be okay
 * but recv will not be.
 *
 *	@todo Level 5 make a new TCPSocket class which has a TIMED_OUT state and has recv, accept,
 *	and timeout options, it could be a friend of the API or be given a pointer to the
 *	API so that it can schedule events (i.e. timeouts)
 *
 * @todo Level 5 make different send modes, currently the user may call send whenever the
 * underlying TCPSocket is in the TCPSocket::CONNECTED or TCPSocket::CONNECTING or
 *	TCPSocket::PEER_CLOSED state, perhaps
 * it would be nice to have a lock step mode such that messages could only be sent when
 *	the socket is actually connected
 *
 *	@see TCPSocketAPI_Base, TCPSocketAPI_Inet, TCPSocket, TCPSocketMap, IPAddressResolver,
 * SocketTimeoutMsg, TCPCommand.
 *
 * @todo Check documentation.
